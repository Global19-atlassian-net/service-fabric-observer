ClusterObserver (CO) is a standalone SF singleton stateless service that runs on one node (1) and is 
independent from FabricObserver, which runs on all nodes (-1). CO observes cluster health (aggregated) 
and sends telemetry when cluster is in Error (and optionally in Warning). 
CO shares a very small subset of FabricObserver's (FO) code. It is designed to be completely independent from FO sources, 
but lives in this repo (and SLN) because it is very useful to have both services deployed, 
especially for those who want cluster-level health observation and reporting in addition to 
the node-level user-defined resource monitoring, health event creation, and health reporting done by FO. FabricObserver is designed to generate Service Fabric health events based on user-defined resource usage Warning and Error thresholds which ClusterObserver sends to your log analytics and alerting service.

By design, CO will send an Ok health state report when a cluster goes from Warning or Error state to Ok.

CO only sends telemetry when something is wrong or when something that was previously wrong recovers. This limits 
the amount of data sent to your log analytics service. Like FabricObserver, you can implement whatever analytics backend 
you want by implementing the IObserverTelemetryProvider interface. As stated, this is already implemented for both Azure ApplicationInsights and Azure LogAnalytics. 

The core idea is that you use the aggregated cluster error/warning/Ok health state information from ClusterObserver to fire alerts and/or trigger some other action that gets your attention and/or some SF on-call's enagement via auto-creating a support incident (and an Ok signal would mean auto-mitigate the related incident/ticket).

Example Configuration:  

```XML
  <Section Name="ObserverManagerConfiguration">
    <!-- Required: Amount of time, in seconds, to sleep before the next iteration of observers run loop. 
         0 means run continuously with no pausing. We recommend at least 60 seconds for ClusterObserver. -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverLoopSleepTimeSeconds" Value="60" />
    <!-- Required: Amount of time, in seconds, ClusterObserver is allowed to complete a run. If this time is exceeded, 
         then the offending observer will be marked as broken and will not run again. 
         Below setting represents 30 minutes. -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverExecutionTimeout" Value="1800" />
    <!-- Optional: This observer makes async SF Api calls that are cluster-wide operations and can take time in large clusters. -->
    <Parameter Name="ClusterOperationTimeoutSeconds" Value="120" />
    <!-- Required: Location on disk to store observer data, including ObserverManager. 
         ClusterObserver will write to its own directory on this path.-->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverLogPath" Value="C:\observer_logs" />
    <!-- Required: Enabling this will generate noisy logs. Disabling it means only Warning and Error information 
         will be locally logged. This is the recommended setting. Note that file logging is generally
         only useful for FabricObserverWebApi, which is an optional log reader service that ships in this repo. -->
    <Parameter Name="EnableVerboseLogging" Value="False" />
    <Parameter Name="EnableEventSourceProvider" Value="True"/>
    <Parameter Name="EventSourceProviderName" Value="ClusterObserverETWProvider" />
    <!-- Optional: Diagnostic Telemetry. Azure ApplicationInsights and Azure LogAnalytics support is already implemented, 
         but you can implement whatever provider you want. See IObserverTelemetry interface. -->
    <Parameter Name="EnableTelemetryProvider" Value="True" />
    <!-- Required: Supported Values are AzureApplicationInsights or AzureLogAnalytics as these providers are implemented. -->
    <Parameter Name="TelemetryProvider" Value="AzureLogAnalytics" />
    <!-- Required-If TelemetryProvider is AzureApplicationInsights. -->
    <Parameter Name="AppInsightsInstrumentationKey" Value="" />
    <!-- Required-If TelemetryProvider is AzureLogAnalytics. Your Workspace Id. -->
    <Parameter Name="LogAnalyticsWorkspaceId" Value="" />
    <!-- Required-If TelemetryProvider is AzureLogAnalytics. Your Shared Key. -->
    <Parameter Name="LogAnalyticsSharedKey" Value="" />
    <!-- Required-If TelemetryProvider is AzureLogAnalytics. Log scope. Default is Application. -->
    <Parameter Name="LogAnalyticsLogType" Value="Application" />
    <!-- Optional: Amount of time in seconds to wait before ObserverManager signals shutdown. -->
    <Parameter Name="ObserverShutdownGracePeriodInSeconds" Value="1" />
  </Section>
  <!-- ClusterObserver Configuration Settings -->
  <Section Name="ClusterObserverConfiguration">
    <!-- Required: To enable or not enable, that is the question.-->
    <Parameter Name="Enabled" Value="True" />
    <!-- Optional: Enabling this will generate noisy logs. Disabling it means only Warning and Error information 
         will be locally logged. This is the recommended setting. Note that file logging is generally
         only useful for FabricObserverWebApi, which is an optional log reader service that ships in this repo. -->
    <Parameter Name="EnableVerboseLogging" Value="False" />
    <!-- Optional: Emit health details for both Warning and Error for aggregated cluster health? 
         Aggregated Error evaluations will always be transmitted regardless of this setting. -->
    <Parameter Name="EmitHealthWarningEvaluationDetails" Value="True" />
    <!-- Optional: Emit Ok aggregated health state telemetry when cluster health goes from Warning or Error to Ok. -->
    <Parameter Name="EmitOkHealthStateTelemetry" Value="True" />
    <!-- Maximum amount of time a node can be in disabling/disabled/down state before
         emitting a Warning signal.-->
    <Parameter Name="MaxTimeNodeStatusNotOk" Value="02:00:00"/>

You should configure FabricObserver to monitor ClusterObserver, of course. :)
